h1. Project Sprouts

Project Sprouts is an open-source, cross-platform project generation and configuration tool for whatever technology you use. At the time of this writing, we have support for ActionScript 2, ActionScript 3, Flex and AIR projects.

Sprouts includes support for project and code templates, automated build scripts, remote managed libraries, and automatic installation of executable dependencies like runtimes, compilers and other utilities.

Sprouts works on OS X, Windows XP, Windows Vista and many flavors of *nix (including Solaris thanks to lots of patience from Armaghan Chaudhary).
